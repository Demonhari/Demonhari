# üß© AI Project Portfolio ‚Äì Harikrishnan K S

Welcome to my AI engineering portfolio.  
This repository collects several independent machine learning and computer vision projects I've developed across edge, cloud, and research environments.

Each subproject demonstrates an aspect of production-ready AI systems ‚Äî from real-time defect detection on Jetson devices to LLM-based RAG implementations.
